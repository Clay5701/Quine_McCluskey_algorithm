/**
 * @struct BinaryMinterm
 * @brief Represents a minterm with its binary form, associated decimal values, and grouping information.
 *
 * The `BinaryMinterm` struct is used to store and manipulate minterms in the Quine-McCluskey method.
 * - `binary`: A string representing the minterm in binary form (e.g., `"01-1"`). Dashes (`-`) are allowed
 *   to indicate "don't-care" bits.
 * - `terms`: A vector containing the decimal values represented by the binary string. 
 *   For example, `"01-1"` corresponds to `{5, 7}`.
 * - `group`: Initially set to the number of `1`s in the `binary` string, but as minterms are combined,
 *   it takes the smallest group number of the combined terms.
